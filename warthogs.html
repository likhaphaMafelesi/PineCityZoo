                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs. They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa</p>
                <p>Warthogs are day animals and spend most of their time looking for food. They are normally found in family groups. Warthogs have the peculiar habit of kneeling </p>
                <p>Size:

Height: 60–85 cm (2–2.8 ft) at the shoulder

Length: Around 1.3 meters (4.3 ft)

Weight: 50–150 kg (110–330 lbs), with males larger than females

Appearance:

Large head with warty facial bumps (especially males) – these are thick pads of skin, not actual warts

Curved tusks: Upper tusks can grow up to 25 cm (10 in) – used for defense and digging

Sparse hair and a mane along the spine

Long tail with a tuft at the end – held upright like a flag when running</p>
    
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen E18, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
