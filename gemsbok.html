               <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                 <p>The gemsbok, or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival</p>
                 <p>Size: Around 1.2 meters (4 feet) at the shoulder; can weigh up to 240 kg (530 lbs).

Horns: Both males and females have long, straight or slightly curved hornsâ€”females tend to have longer, thinner horns; males' are thicker and used for fighting.</p>
                 <p>Water independence: Gemsbok can survive without drinking water for months by extracting moisture from food like wild melons, roots, and grasses.

Heat regulation: They have specialized blood-cooling systems in their heads to protect the brain from overheating.

Nocturnal feeding: In extreme heat, they may graze at night to conserve energy and moisture.</p>
                 <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                 <p>You will find the gamsbok at pen E30, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
